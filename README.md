# Awful OSS Incidents
A categorized list of incidents caused by unappreciated OSS maintainers or underfunded OSS library projects. Feedback welcome!

The Goal of this classification and list of incidents is to identify and analyze reasons why some OSS maintainers do intentionally cause problems for the larger software ecosystem and to determine potential solutions.

## Context

In the beginning developing OSS is often great for the maintainer - there are no constraints on the tech or features, only few bugs exists, the maintainer can work as and when he wants, there are only his own expectations to fulfill, and the few users appreciate the project. Furthermore, working on the open-source project helps them to sharpen their skills, build a reputation for themselves, gain perspectives on the topic from the community, or simply help the industry by making innovations available at no cost.

But if a project gets more attention and users the heat increases. More and more users want new features, bug-fixes, more docu and tutorials, etc. Companies using the project want fixes to problems asap (e.g., for [cURL](https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc)) - esp. if it concerns their own SLAs - all without previously funding or currently supporting the project. And most of Companies systems and the Internet's infrastructure at large are using open-source libraries developed by few maintainers and without funding - wonderfully visualized in a xkcd comic.

![xkcd comic](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png)

This ever increasing workload and lack of funding often causes maintainers to get unhappy and sometimes even leave their project or run amok and cause problems for the user base. With more funding most of the identified problems could be mitigated. Funding enables maintainers of open-source projects to:
* **pay themselves** a (part-time or full-time) salary to have more time to develop new features, fix bugs, and better maintain the software
* **pay contributors** to develop new features & fix bugs (e.g., via bug bounties), hire a logo designer, hire a website designer, etc.
* **improve their project** by registering trademark(s), buy a domain, pay for hosting, ...
* **sponsor other projects** (e.g., dependencies, tools, etc.)
* **advertise their projects**, sponsor meetups & conferences, etc.
* **sponsor team events** for other maintainers, contributors or the community itself
* **sponsor team expenses** such as hardware (laptops), conference tickets, local hosting cost, etc.
* **found a Startup** and pay initial legal fees, taxes, etc.

## Incident Categories
... many incidents happened over time
... we classified them based on the core problem.

> Please Note that we do not take sides and every side has it's own story. We just try to categorize and describe the problems, history, and consequences based on some articles.

### Trademark infringements
A part of an open-source project can sometime cause problems when the name of the project, the logo, or something else used in the project causes an infringement on the Trademark, Figurative Mark, Brand, etc. Furthermore, a trademark might even have been registered after the project was created or in different jurisdictions that have not been checked (e.g., trademarks can be registered in a country (e.g., Italy), a union of countries (e.g., the EU) or internationally).

Trademark infringements are often caused by an oversight or ignorance from the open-source maintainer as well as the trademark owner or by "Trademark Trolls" registering the trademark to harm the project.

__Examples__
* (March 2016): Azer Koçulu unpublished over 250 modules (esp. `left-pad`) from npm due to trademark infringement over the name "kik" - breaking tens of thousands of projects that depended on it. [[Blog Post](https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/)] [[Azer's version](https://web.archive.org/web/20160330050734/https://medium.com/@azerbike/i-ve-just-liberated-my-modules-9045c06be67c)] [[kik's version](https://medium.com/@mproberts/a-discussion-about-the-breaking-of-the-internet-3d4d2a83aa4d#.ld8o5zqz7)]

__Potential Solutions__
* Register trademark for the open-source project [drawback: extra cost]
* Research trademarks periodically [drawback: extra work]

### Programming mistake
All software system can have minor or major bugs that prevent their intended use in different scenarios. When a open-source maintainer publishes a faulty project the effect can be felt by many of its users.

Programming mistakes are causes by oversights, missing tests, integration problems, corrupt dependencies, and in general due to no having enough time for checking the system in production-like environments.

__Examples__
* (Apr 2014): A programming mistake by a single maintainer of `openSSL` led to a vulnerability (a.k.a. **Heartbleed**) that allowed stealing information and passwords from users.
  * OpenSSL, received just $2,000 per year in donations which grew to $9,000 after the issue was found. (The global cost for the software industry was [estimated to be as high as $500 million](https://www.eweek.com/security/heartbleed-ssl-flaw-s-true-cost-will-take-time-to-tally/))
  * [The Heartbleed Vulnerability](https://heartbleed.com/)
* (April 2020) Forbes Lindesay released version 2.2.0 of the `is-promised` library that didn't adhere to the proper ES module standards causing wide-spread build errors. This release led to bugs in popular build tools used to create new projects, such as Facebook's create-react-app, Google's firebase-tools, Amazon's AWS Serverless CLI, Nuxt.js, AVA, angular-cli, and others. [[Blog Post](https://www.zdnet.com/google-amp/article/another-one-line-npm-package-breaks-the-javascript-ecosystem/)] [[Forbes' Post-mortem](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/is-promise-post-mortem-cab807f18dcc)]
* (Dec 2021): `log4j` enabled a feature from 2013 by default that allowed loading of malicious code.
  * [The Log4j Vulnerability](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance)

__Potential Solutions__
* Write more tests / safe-guards [drawback: extra effort]
* Use Quality-Gates (other people checking usage) [drawback: extra effort]
* Use Bug bounties [drawback: extra cost]

### Package Ownership Disputes
The maintainer of a open-source library is often the owner of a package on a registry and is the only one allowed to change, delete, or publish new versions. The account of the owner in the registry is often linked to an email address and can only be transferred by the registry operators. If the ownership of a package is transferred this can lead to incompatible libraries (with the same name) or malicious code deleting data or stealing information.

Package ownership problems are often caused by hacked password / credentials, an oversight or misunderstanding by the registry operator, or general contact problems.

__Examples__
* (Aug. 2021) During the process of getting packages for a project called `bebop` published in various software repositories, Andrew Sampson found that it was unclaimed except in NPM. After inquiring the NPM registry the ownership of the package `bebop` was auto-transferred to Andrew due to a corrupt contact address of the former owner Zach Kelling. [[Blog Post](https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/10/github_npm_package/)]

__Potential Solutions__
* Stronger authentification (e.g., 2FA) [drawback: extra effort]
* Continuous contact confirmation [drawback: extra effort]
* Always using scopes / usernames [depends on registry]

### Usage Disputes
The usage of an open-source project can sometime cause problems when third-parties (e.g. Cloud provider) offer them commercially and/or the maintainer community wants to commercialize and builds a Startup.

Usage disputes are causes by different point of views how an open-source project should be used or commercialized. Even if the positions are legally clear the dispute can affect and impair the users.

__Examples__
* (Aug. 2021): Elasticsearch introduced a breaking change to its widely used JS client library `elasticsearch-js` to not work with AWS Elasticsearch and OpenSearch anymore. [[Github Issue](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-js/issues/1519)]

__Potential Solutions__
* Not being dependent on a Company's library? [drawback: extra effort]

### Security Problems / Hacked Accounts / Criminal Intentions

Causes: Oversight, No time for tests, Corrupt Dependencies, Hacks

__Examples__
* In September 2018, a small package called `event-stream` was infected with malicious code that targeted a specific company and could steal passwords for crypto accounts [NPM Incident Report](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident)
  * In November 2018, it was discovered that a malicious package had been added as a dependency to version 3.3.6 of the popular package event-stream. The malicious package, called flatmap-stream, contained an encrypted payload that stole bitcoins from certain applications. npm administrators removed the offending package.[16][17]
* (Oct. 2021): The NPM account for the `UA-Parser-JS` library was hacked, to infect dependent systems with cryptominers and password-stealing trojans in a supply-chain attack. [Full Story](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/popular-npm-library-hijacked-to-install-password-stealers-miners/)
* (Apr 2022): A flaw in the NPM registry allowed adding maintainers to own projects (a.k.a. "Package Planting") - giving a false sense of credibility / security of potentially harmful packages. [Full Story](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/npm-flaw-let-attackers-add-anyone-as-maintainer-to-malicious-packages/)
* In July 2018, the npm credentials of a maintainer of the popular `eslint-scope` package were compromised resulting in a malicious release of eslint-scope, version 3.7.2. The malicious code copied the npm credentials of the machine running eslint-scope and uploaded them to the attacker.[15] 

__Potential Solutions__
* Write more tests / safe-guards [drawback: extra effort]
* Use bounties for Hacks [drawback: extra cost]
* Stronger authentification (e.g., 2FA) [drawback: extra effort]
* Continuous contact confirmation [drawback: extra effort]

### Cyber-Warfare

__Examples__
* In March 2022, developer Brandon Nozaki Miller released a version of the package node-ipc containing malicious code that would delete files from users with Belarusian and Russian IP addresses, in protest of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Vue.js, which uses node-ipc as a dependency, did not pin its dependencies to a safe version, meaning that some users of Vue.js became affected by the malicious package if the dependency was fetched as the latest package.[20][21] The affected dependency was also briefly present in version 3.1 of Unity Hub; a hotfix was released the same day to remove the issue, however.[22]

__Potential Solutions__
* ???

### Developer Burnout
Developer Burnout / Infocide / Disgruntled Developers
Causes: Pressure from Users, Disillusionment, Private problems

__Examples__
* (Jan. 2022): Marak Squiress intentionally introduced changes to break the functionality and later deletes his projects `colors.js` and `faker.js` after getting pushed / bullied by corporates. [Original Message](http://web.archive.org/web/20210704022108/https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/issues/1046) [Full Story](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/)
  * https://hacker-news.news/post/27252066

__Potential Solutions__
* Better monetization mechanisms



## Examples for working Monetization
* cURL? [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/) 
  * Story: https://onezero.medium.com/the-internet-relies-on-people-working-for-free-a79104a68bcc

## Misc / Aftertoughts
* maintainer account takeovers [`ua-parser-js`](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pjwm-rvh2-c87w)

* GitHubs site-policy [2022](https://github.com/github/site-policy/issues/513) 
* NPM project reconstruction 
... problematic as copyright, brand, and name (handle) is owned by the author/maintainer and assuming the identity of the author is borderline illegal (at least the companies are liable and take warranty that the offered (old) versions are correct)
